Sense-Hat-Simulator
===================

### About

This is your project's README.md file. It helps users understand what your
project does, how to use it and anything else they may need to know.

- Sense Hat Simulator example without Device Stats flow. There are the following flows:
    - `flow-simple.json` is a sample flow with only the Sense Hat simulator, without Pusher streaming
    - `flow-stream-Pusher.json` includes streaming data using Pusher
    - `flow-stream-mqtt.json` includes streaming data using Pusher

**NOTE 1:** Being a NodeRED project, it always reads `flow.json`. If the file doesnÂ´'t exist the editor will open with an empty flow
**NOTE 2:** These scripts are included in this repository for documentation purposes. Being a NodeRED project they are launched from the NodeRED instance, i.e. `chapter3`
